Not all articles are considered - only non-technical (no "Wikipedia:", "Category:", etc.).

Most human-picked articles are at distance ~3.
Analyzing all articles is harder. Random search with 200 samples found out that:
- Only 92% had any path, and out of those:
- Average path length was 4.538
- Median path length was 4
- Longest path length was 8

However it is clear that not all articles are interconnected and the
longest path in the set is at least 95 long.
